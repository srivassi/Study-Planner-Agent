## Features

### Dashboard
- Daily task list pulled from the study plan
- Streak tracking and weekly activity graph (counts focus sessions, Gauntlet plays, and question answering)
- Stats: total focus minutes, tasks completed, day streak

### Study Plan
- AI generates a full task breakdown from a syllabus or course description
- Tasks scheduled across available days respecting exam dates and disruptions (blocked periods)
- Adaptive rescheduling: tell the agent what changed and it rebalances the remaining plan

### Focus (Pomodoro)
- Customisable Pomodoro timer (25/5, 50/10, or custom)
- Animated focus scenes: coffee pour, growing plant, candle — progress through stages as the session advances
- Space bar to start/pause; done screen with confetti

### Whiteboard
- Upload PDFs per module; multi-page note workspace
- AI chat grounded on the uploaded PDF
- Fork any note into a new page

### Flashcards
- Create and manage flashcard sets per module
- Flip cards, track progress through a set

### Question Bank
- **Past paper extraction** — upload a PDF exam paper; Claude extracts every question with model answers and topic labels
- **AI generation** — generate MCQ, short answer, essay, or mixed question sets from any uploaded lecture PDF; optionally specify count and custom instructions
- **Adaptive regeneration** — when regenerating, the prompt is automatically enriched with which topics the user got wrong or hasn't attempted yet
- **MCQ UI** — A/B/C/D option buttons, two-step select → Check flow, green/red reveal with explanation
- **Written answer grading** — Claude grades responses as Excellent / Good / Developing / Insufficient with constructive, second-person feedback
- **Session score tracking** — live score bar showing MCQ correct/total and average written grade across the session
- **Bank management** — view all banks per module, drill into a specific bank, delete banks

### Games
- **Goblet of Fire** — Socratic Q&A tutor powered by Claude. Upload a PDF, get broken into topics, earn stars per topic through back-and-forth discussion
- **Jeopardy** — Flashcard game-show mode; pick a set and race through questions

### Settings
